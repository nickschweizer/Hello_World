## Project Title
*Credit Card Balance Tracker*



## Description
- I created a program that prompts the user to enter information regarding their credit card to see what the balance will be after x number of months.
- The program also allows the user to see how long it would take to pay of the balance based on their monthly payments that they input.


## How to Run Program
When the user clicks on ==run== , the program asks for balance, purchases each month, number of months, and yearly interest rate.
